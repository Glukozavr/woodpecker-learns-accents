Welcome to Woodpecker Learns Accents!

This game combines 2 themes - Accent and Save the Forest.
How? Well, there is an infestation of termites that want to eat the entire forest. You need to Save it!
There are 3 zones, each has different trees and different termites. They attack with loud cries and sound waves, but differently because they have... different accents!
You got it?

Controls are:
* Move with arrows
* Jump with space and hold to fly
* During flight/in the air press Z to attack downside

That's it. Destory all termites and Sace the Forest! To do it you will need to learn their Accents (this is a code for learning how to destory them)
